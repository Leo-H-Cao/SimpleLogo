### Method or Class
* Design issues

* Design issue



## Refactoring Plan

* What are the code's biggest issues?
  * ASTMaker is an extremely long and clunky class
  * Event handlers are hard to pass into frontend without direct reference
  to object owning handling method

* Which issues are easy to fix and which are hard?
  * ASTMaker is hard to refactor because its functionality is extremely
  complex.
  * Event handlers is not as hard if observer listener pattern is used

* What are good ways to implement the changes "in place"?
  * Don't change public/protected method signatures such that outside
  classes that may depend on the function will still work properly



## Refactoring Work

* Issue chosen: Fix and Alternatives
