Notes on Syntax Parser from looking at it from outside perspective:

1) I like having a unified API through Command. My only suggestion would be that I think that
unless you plan on adding concrete fields and/or methods to Command that it might be better to
make it an interface instead of a parent class.

2) I think that perhaps ArithmeticOp type values should be an enumeration instead of a String, I think that
while it may make the code more verbose that it would be a better design. I added a sample of how this
class could look.

3) I think instead of having a switch statement for the logic of ArithmeticOp that it would be a better
design principal to subclass ArithmeticOp, especially because this makes it easier to add more ArithmeticOp
commands (such as exponentiation) while leaving the code "closed to modification." Also this could allow
for easier error checking in operation specific edge cases like checking for divide by zero for division.
